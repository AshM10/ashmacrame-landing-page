      <p>
        My journey with macrame began on April 2019, when I saw all these
        amazing Instagram posts about Macrame. I was inspired to try to learn it
        myself and so, I did! I started learning the materials used, the
        different knots used so on and so forth. I created all kinds of Macrame
        stuff that I could sell or gift or to keep for my self. It's been a
        crazy ride, with my arms and back aching from knotting too much, but I
        would never ever replace Macrame with anything in this world. I created
        this page to showcase some of my Macrame Creations for you to view and
        enjoy!

            On the top is the largest Macrame piece I've ever made, it took me
            three days to finish it. All of the driftwoods I used are from
            different places I went to. I handpicked them and took them home.
            Some of the places where I got them are the Grand Canyon, Muir Woods
            and South Padre Island.

          <h3>Macrame Bouquet Holder</h3>
          <p>
            This photo is a Macrame Bouquet Holder I made. I have a hard time
            throwing away bouquet of flowers my special someone gives me on
            special ocassions. So, I always dry the flowers and display them.
            One thing I thought was cute is to make a bouquet holder for the
            dried flowers. It's a good way to keep these flowers longer.

        These are Macrame Keychains I made to gift to my closest girl friends
        and family. I love making these because they're the easiest ones to make
        and doesn't require too much rope! I can just whip one up and create an
        instant gift, especially when I want to make a friend feel extra
        special! I love seeing them hung these on their purses!

          <p>
            This Macrame Shelf was made for a friend of mine who wanted
            something to be useful as well as being eye-catching. She wanted
            something she can dispplay in her bedroom and something she can put
            her books and plants on. And so, I made her this from woods she
            herself selected.

          <h3>Macrame Lamp Shade</h3>
          <p>
            Our late aunt gave us a very beautiful vintage lamp. It was really
            old and the shade was dirty and there were a lot of stains on it. I
            wanted to create something special out of this gorgeous lamp, that's
            why I took off the cloth from the shade and used the shade's metal
            structure to make this amazing piece. It looks very different from
            day to night.
